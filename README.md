# PCA_study_framework

This framework is to help Data Scientist to quick make a PCA analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).
The PCA help to determine wich features contribute to explain the distribution of data. It is an interesting approach to reduce the number of features and make model faster to run, but also to easily combine features in one dimension.
